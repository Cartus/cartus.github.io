Hi! :clap: My name is Zhijiang Guo (郭志江). I am a Researcher at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/) and a Visiting Researcher at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). Before that, I was a Postdoc at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge from 2020-2022, working with Prof. [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io//). I am also a member of [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/). 

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Lu](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei). I was a visiting student at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) from 2019-2020, working with Prof. [Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/) and Prof. [Giorgio Satta](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~satta/) on Structured Prediction.  I also gained valuable insights from Prof. [Zhiyang Teng](http://zeeeyang.github.io/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).

**I will join the [DSA](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [Information Hub](https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) at [HKUST (GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) in 2025 as an Assistant Professor. I am actively looking for strong and motivated students to join our group! Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in PhD, RA, or Intern.**

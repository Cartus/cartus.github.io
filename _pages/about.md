Hi! :clap: My name is Zhijiang Guo (郭志江). I am an Assistant Professor at the [DSA Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [HKUST (GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). I am also an Affiliated Assistant Professor of HKUST. I was a Senior Researcher at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/). Before that, I was a Postdoc at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working with Prof. [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io//). I am also a member of [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/). 

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Lu](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei). I was a visiting student at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) from 2019-2020, working with Prof. [Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/) and Prof. [Giorgio Satta](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~satta/) on Structured Prediction.  I also gained valuable insights from Prof. [Zhiyang Teng](http://zeeeyang.github.io/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).

**I actively seek strong and motivated students to join our group! Feel free to email me if you are interested. More details can be found in [Prospective Students and Visitors](https://cartus.github.io/news/announcement_2/)/[中文版](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/9909735774).**

I am interested in natural language processing and machine learning, with a particular focus on large language models (LLMs). My research explores fundamental research questions about the **knowledge** and **reasoning** of LLMs, examining how these systems understand and process information.

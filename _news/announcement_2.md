Dr. Zhijiang Guo will join the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as an Assistant Professor in Spring 2025. The research group hopes to recruit several PhD students and research assistants for enrollment in 2025. We warmly encourage prospective applicants for the Fall 2025 PhD program to consider applying for a research assistant position first. We would greatly appreciate it if interested applicants could read the guidelines below and submit their applications via email as instructed.

### About the Mentor

Zhijiang is currently a researcher at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and a visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge. He focuses on research in natural language processing and machine learning, with his current interests primarily centered around large language models (LLMs). He has published over 30 papers in leading conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, COLM, TACL, ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL, with several selected for Oral or Spotlight presentations, and has over 2300 citations on Google Scholar.

He has served as an Area Chair (AC) for ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and COLING, as well as a Senior Program Committee (SPC) member for AAAI and IJCAI. He has also been an Action Editor (AE) for the ACL Rolling Review and co-organized multiple FEVER workshops at ACL, EMNLP, and EACL. He earned his bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University, and then completed his PhD under Prof. Wei Lu at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. He was a visiting researcher in Prof. Shay Cohen's group at the University of Edinburgh. He conducted postdoctoral research in Prof. Andreas Vlachos's group at the University of Cambridge before joining Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in 2023.

### About the University

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) is one of the leading research institutions in Asia and globally. In 2025, HKUST ranked 47th in the QS World University Rankings and 3rd in the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings. In September 2022, HKUST (Guangzhou) was established, focusing on interdisciplinary development to complement each other. The curriculum is designed around four key areas: information, function, systems, and society, with research fields covering emerging areas such as data science, robotics and automation systems, artificial intelligence, and advanced materials. Currently, HKUST (Guangzhou) is located in Nansha, Guangzhou. The university offers a monthly scholarship of 18,000 HKD for doctoral students, and the teaching environment is entirely in English.

### Experience in Mentoring

He has mentored over ten students at Cambridge and Huawei Noah's Ark, most of whom have published papers at top conferences, including their first papers. I respect students' interests and am dedicated to helping them grow in all aspects. I have written recommendation letters for many of my collaborating students (the application season is quite exhausting though). You can find the students I have mentored [here](https://cartus.github.io/members/). For more about my mentoring style, feel free to contact them; I have obtained their consent for this XD.

### For PhD Students

As I will be joining the university in the spring of 2025, I am currently looking for students to start in the fall of 2025. Here are some key requirements I hope potential candidates will consider:

- Passionate about the fundamental research of LLMs, along with a desire to contribute to impactful scientific work. While it’s perfectly fine to begin with shorter projects, I hope that as we progress, we can collaborate on higher-quality, more influential research.
- Strong mathematical and programming skills, with a willingness to learn and explore new ideas. Given the rapid advancements in our field, staying proactive is essential to keep up.
- A solid foundation in English writing and publication. The admission requirements for HKUST (GZ) include an IELTS score of 6.5 or a TOEFL score of 80. However, I believe that strong communication skills are equally important. Good writing can make a significant difference in sharing your ideas, and effective communication is vital for networking at conferences. I would be happy to attend conferences with you and can help introduce you to others in the field.

I will give priority to applicants who meet the following criteria:

- Experience in large models, machine learning, or natural language processing, with publications in key conferences such as ML (ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR), NLP (ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/EACL), or LLM (COLM). I focus on these venues, as well as some journals (TACL/TMLR).
- Strong programming abilities and involvement in meaningful open-source projects related to LLMs.
- Previous experience as a research assistant in our lab or collaborators. I value working with individuals with whom I have had positive experiences, as our time together during the PhD will be collaborative and intensive.

### 研究助理/实习生/访问学生

1. 时间方面：春季就可以加入了，不需要等到秋季。如果咱们合作愉快的话，也非常欢迎你留下成为博士生。如果你想去看看外面更大的世界，我也非常愿意推荐你到其他海外学校。
2. 实习生和访问学生都可以远程，具体的情况可以讨论决定，我比较flexible。
3. 希望组里主要围绕几个重点的方向，如果我们的研究兴趣差异比较大的话，我可能比较难以提供有效的指导。为了能参与所有同学的研究，目前不打算招太多的同学。
4. 非常提倡组内积极讨论和合作，希望所有的同学都能积极参与组会的讨论，还有论文的分享。

### 一些关键信息

1. 非常希望申请者的研究兴趣和我比较能对齐（这个是最重要的！），我目前主要关注大模型的事实性，推理和知识（参见主页和最近的论文发表情况）。因为我还是希望能够手把手帮助每一位同学的研究，包括idea的提出和讨论，实验的设计，论文的撰写投稿，rebuttal等等。改代码可能会比较困难，不过如果有需要我也会一起努力。
2. 我对申请者的学历专业背景并没有那么看重。比较重视的是学习和工作的态度和抗压能力。大模型的研究并不是rocket science，很多时候更加需要的是严谨的态度和持之以恒的精神。抗压能力不是指我会给学生施加压力，我并不会这样做。是指现在AI的研究社区非常大，审稿充满不确定性，有时候自己长时间努力的成果并不能得到审稿人的赏识，而且博士还有发表的要求（毕业之后找工作非常需要）。即使第一次投稿失败，我也希望我们能一起努力，发表有影响力的论文。
3. 我非常鼓励合作，包括和全球各地学术界和业界的研究者，包括博士期间的交换，还有实习（全球范围）。因为我自己就是全球合作交流的获益者，在海内外也有一定的connections，会帮助你去交流和实习。
4. 指导风格的话，每周至少一对一讨论一次。如果有需要讨论的话，其实随时都可以找我或者留言，我会尽快安排时间做短的讨论。每周还会组织组会，希望组里的同学能了解其他同学的研究方向（所以不希望组太大），还有论文分享会（认真学习高质量的论文很重要），我也会定期邀请全球学术界和业界的研究者来开讲座。
5. 港科广是新学校，如果非常介意学校名气和排名的话，可能不太适合申请这边的博士。

### 申请方式

请发送邮件到：cartusguo@gmail.com，为了提高大家的效率，恳请邮件的主要内容包括**1.您的研究方向或研究兴趣；2.对我的哪些研究方向/论文感兴趣。**，其他详细信息以附件的形式附在邮件即可（比如简历，成绩单等等）。
格式为“Year-Position-Your Name-Affiliation”, 例如 25Fall-PhD-Wukong-SYSU.

对于所有投递我都会尽快阅读并进行评估，若简历通过筛选，会有邮件通知面试。

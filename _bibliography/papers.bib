  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing capability in problem-solving and decision-making, largely based on the step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning processes. However, it has been increasingly challenging to evaluate the reasoning capability of LLMs. Concretely, existing outcome-based benchmarks begin to saturate and become less sufficient to monitor the progress. To this end, we present a process-based benchmark Mr-Ben that demands a meta reasoning skill, where LMs are asked to locate and analyse potential errors in automatically generated reasoning steps. Mr-Ben is a comprehensive benchmark comprising 5,975 questions collected from human experts, covering various subjects such as physics, chemistry, logic, coding, and more. Through our designed metrics for assessing meta-reasoning on this benchmark, we identify interesting limitations and weaknesses of current LLMs (open-source and closed-source models). For example, open-source models are seemingly comparable to GPT-4 on outcome-based benchmarks, but they lag far behind on our benchmark, revealing the underlying reasoning capability gap between them. Our dataset and codes are available on https://randolph-zeng.github.io/Mr-Ben.github.io/.}

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in understanding long-form contents. However, exploring their capability for generating long-form contents, such as reports and articles, has been relatively unexplored and inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks. The prevalent evaluation methods, which predominantly rely on crowdsourcing, are recognized for their labor-intensive nature and lack of efficiency, whereas automated metrics, such as the ROUGE score, demonstrate discordance with human judgment criteria. In this paper, we propose ProxyQA, an innovative framework dedicated to assessing long-text generation. ProxyQA comprises in-depth human-curated meta-questions spanning various domains, each accompanied by specific proxy-questions with pre-annotated answers. LLMs are tasked to generate extensive content in response to these meta-questions, by engaging an evaluator and incorporating the generated texts as contextual background, ProxyQA assesses the generated content{'}s quality through the evaluator{'}s accuracy in addressing the proxy-questions. We examine multiple LLMs, emphasizing ProxyQA{'}s demanding nature as a high-quality assessment tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that the proxy-question method is notably self-consistent and aligns closely with human evaluative standards.

Misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. However, existing datasets for rumor detection mainly focus on a single modality i.e., text. To bridge this gap, we construct MR2, a multimodal multilingual retrieval-augmented dataset for rumor detection. The dataset covers rumors with images and texts, and provides evidence from both modalities that are retrieved from the Internet. Further, we develop established baselines and conduct a detailed analysis of the systems evaluated on the dataset. Extensive experiments show that MR2 will provide a challenging testbed for developing rumor detection systems designed to retrieve and reason over social media posts.

The quality of the retrieved evidence plays an important role in claim verification. Ideally, the retrieved evidence should be faithful (reflecting the model's decision-making process in claim verification) and plausible (convincing to humans), and can improve the accuracy of verification task. Although existing approaches leverage the similarity measure of semantic or surface form between claims and documents to retrieve evidence, they all rely on certain heuristics that prevent them from satisfying all three requirements. In light of this, we propose a fact verification model named ReRead to retrieve evidence and verify claim that: (1) Train the evidence retriever to obtain interpretable evidence (i.e., faithfulness and plausibility criteria); (2) Train the claim verifier to revisit the evidence retrieved by the optimized evidence retriever to improve the accuracy. The proposed system is able to achieve significant improvements upon best-reported models under different settings.}

In order to explore the impact of pandemics on people's lives, it is crucial to understand the public's concerns and attitudes towards pandemic-related entities (e.g., drugs, vaccines) on social media. However, models trained on existing named entity recognition (NER) or targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) datasets have limited ability to understand COVID-19-related social media texts because these datasets are not designed or annotated from a medical perspective. This paper releases METS-CoV, a dataset containing medical entities and targeted sentiments from COVID-19-related tweets. METS-CoV contains 10,000 tweets with 7 types of entities, including 4 medical entity types (Disease, Drug, Symptom, and Vaccine) and 3 general entity types (Person, Location, and Organization). To further investigate tweet users' attitudes toward specific entities, 4 types of entities (Person, Organization, Drug, and Vaccine) are selected and annotated with user sentiments, resulting in a targeted sentiment dataset with 9,101 entities (in 5,278 tweets). To the best of our knowledge, METS-CoV is the first dataset to collect medical entities and corresponding sentiments of COVID-19-related tweets. We benchmark the performance of classical machine learning models and state-of-the-art deep learning models on NER and TSA tasks with extensive experiments. Results show that the dataset has vast room for improvement for both NER and TSA tasks. METS-CoV is an important resource for developing better medical social media tools and facilitating computational social science research, especially in epidemiology. Our data, annotation guidelines, benchmark models, and source code are publicly available (this https URL) to ensure reproducibility.}

Scene graphs play an important role in many cross modality tasks, as they are able to capture the interactions between images and texts. In this paper, we focus on scene graph modification (SGM), where the system is required to learn how to update an existing scene graph based on a natural language query. Unlike previous approaches that rebuilt the entire scene graph, we frame SGM as a graph expansion task by introducing the incremental structure expanding (ISE). ISE constructs the target graph by incrementally expanding the source graph without changing the unmodified structure. Based on ISE, we further propose a model that iterates between nodes prediction and edges prediction, inferring more accurate and harmonious expansion decisions progressively. In addition, we construct a challenging dataset that contains more complicated queries and larger scene graphs than existing datasets. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model by large margins.},

In this paper we introduce a novel dataset and benchmark, Fact Extraction and VERification Over Unstructured and Structured information (FEVEROUS), which consists of 87,026 verified claims. Each claim is annotated with evidence in the form of sentences and/or cells from tables in Wikipedia, as well as a label indicating whether this evidence supports, refutes, or does not provide enough information to reach a verdict. Furthermore, we detail our efforts to track and minimize the biases present in the dataset and could be exploited by models, e.g. being able to predict the label without using evidence. Finally, we develop a baseline for verifying claims against text and tables which predicts both the correct evidence and verdict for 18% of the claims.}

In practice, long-tailed distributions caused by the selection bias of a dataset, may lead to incorrect correlations, also known as spurious correlations, between entities and labels in the conventional likelihood models. This motivates us to propose counterfactual IE (CFIE), a novel framework that aims to uncover the main causalities behind data in the view of causal inference. Specifically, 1) we first introduce a unified structural causal model (SCM) for various IE tasks, describing the relationships among variables; 2) with our SCM, we then generate counterfactuals based on an explicit language structure to better calculate the direct causal effect during the inference stage; 3) we further propose a novel debiasing approach to yield more robust predictions. Experiments on three IE tasks across five public datasets show the effectiveness of our CFIE model in mitigating the spurious correlation issues.}

A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.}

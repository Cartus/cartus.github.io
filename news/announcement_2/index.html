In 2025, HKUST ranked 47th in the QS World University Rankings and 3rd in the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings. In September 2022, HKUST (Guangzhou) was established, focusing on interdisciplinary development to complement each other. The curriculum is designed around four key areas: information, function, systems, and society, with research fields covering emerging areas such as data science, robotics and automation systems, artificial intelligence, and advanced materials. Currently, HKUST (Guangzhou) is located in Nansha, Guangzhou. The university offers a monthly scholarship of 18,000 HKD for doctoral students, and the teaching environment is entirely in English.</p> <h3 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h3> <p>In my early career, I primarily focused on semantics such as AMR, exploring how to derive them (semantic parsing), and how to apply them to various downstream tasks. Recently, I have shifted my attention toward knowledge and reasoning, delving into intriguing questions that intersect with these two areas in the context of LLMs.</p> <ul> <li>Reasoning: This area has become increasingly important in the era of LLMs. I am thrilled to collaborate with insightful researchers around the world. Some of my recent projects include <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16802v4" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AutoPSV</a> (Efficient automated process supervision), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19094" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LeCo</a> (Efficient self-refine and improvements), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13975v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MR-BEN</a> (Evaluate reasoning processes and reflection of LLMs), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15189" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EffiLearner</a> (Self-Optimization with external feedback), and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02954" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DQ-LoRe</a> (Retrieval-Augmented in-context learning). I am particularly interested in mathematical (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01940" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDA</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10135" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FormalAlign</a>) and coding tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11430" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MHPP</a>).</li> <li>Knowledge: I’m glad to be conducting research on knowledge-intensive tasks in Andreas’s group during my postdoc. I mainly focus on how to leverage external knowledge (through retrieval-augmented methods) and internal knowledge (LLMs themselves) to solve problems. This includes applications in question-answering and fact-checking. If you’re unfamiliar with fact-checking, I invite you to check out our <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00454/109469/A-Survey-on-Automated-Fact-Checking" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TACL survey</a>. Some recent works in this area include <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05707" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FEVEROUS</a> (Exploring structured and unstructured knowledge), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13117" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AVeriTec</a> (Addressing real-world fact-checking with external knowledge), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05177" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinocchio</a> (Investigating how LLMs encode factual knowledge), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18727" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CtrlA</a> (Enhancing adaptive retrieval-augmented generation), and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08319" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">knowledge conflicts</a> (Between internal and external Knowledge of LLMs).</li> </ul> <p>Other Interests:</p> <ul> <li>Long Contexts: While previous methods often struggled, there has been significant progress in the last 1-2 years. Recent work has focused on knowledge-intensive long-context tasks, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15042" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ProxyQA</a> (Evaluating long-form generation) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23000" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Long2Rag</a> (Retrieval-augmented generation under long contexts).</li> <li>Efficient Methods: Given the cost implications of LLMs, I have been particularly interested in developing efficient approaches. Beyond the efficient reasoning and coding efforts mentioned earlier, I have also been involved in research on efficient fine-tuning, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19245" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HydraLora</a> (Efficient asymmetric structure of LoRA).</li> <li>LLMs-as-Judges: With their capabilities, LLMs can often be used for evaluation of many things, such as assessing natural language generation or serving as a reward model. Recent projects in this area include <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16950" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PairS</a> (Enhancing alignment with human preferences).</li> </ul> <h3 id="experience-in-mentoring">Experience in Mentoring</h3> <p>He has mentored over ten students at Cambridge and Huawei Noah’s Ark, most of whom have published papers at top conferences, including their first papers. I respect students’ interests and am dedicated to helping them grow in all aspects. I have written recommendation letters for many of my collaborating students (the application season is quite exhausting though). You can find the students I have mentored <a href="https://cartus.github.io/members/">here</a>. For more about my mentoring style, feel free to contact them; I have obtained their consent for this XD.</p> <h3 id="for-phd-students">For PhD Students</h3> <p>As I will be joining the university in the spring of 2025, I am currently looking for students to start in the fall of 2025. Here are some key requirements I hope potential candidates will consider:</p> <ul> <li>Passionate about the fundamental research of LLMs, along with a desire to contribute to impactful scientific work. While it’s perfectly fine to begin with shorter projects, I hope that as we progress, we can collaborate on higher-quality, more influential research.</li> <li>Strong mathematical and programming skills, with a willingness to learn and explore new ideas. Given the rapid advancements in our field, staying proactive is essential to keep up.</li> <li>A solid foundation in English writing and publication. The admission requirements for HKUST (GZ) include an IELTS score of 6.5 or a TOEFL score of 80. However, I believe that strong communication skills are equally important. Good writing can make a significant difference in sharing your ideas, and effective communication is vital for networking at conferences. I would be happy to attend conferences with you and can help introduce you to others in the field.</li> </ul> <p>I will give priority to applicants who meet the following criteria:</p> <ul> <li>Experience in large models, machine learning, or natural language processing, with publications in key conferences such as ML (ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR), NLP (ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/EACL), or LLM (COLM). I focus on these venues, as well as some journals (TACL/TMLR).</li> <li>Strong programming abilities and involvement in meaningful open-source projects related to LLMs.</li> <li>Previous experience as a research assistant in our lab or collaborators. I value working with individuals with whom I have had positive experiences, as our time together during the PhD will be collaborative and intensive.</li> </ul> <h3 id="research-assistantinternvisitors">Research Assistant/Intern/Visitors</h3> <p>I have multiple openings for these positions, but overall, I prefer a smaller group size.</p> <ul> <li>My main goal is for the team to focus on a few key research areas. If our interests diverge significantly, it may be challenging for me to provide effective guidance. To ensure I can engage with all students’ research, I plan to limit the number of recruits.</li> <li>You can start in the spring without waiting until the fall. If our collaboration goes well, I would be delighted to have you continue as a PhD student. If you’re interested in exploring opportunities elsewhere, I would be more than happy to recommend you to other institutions abroad; this year, I’ve already submitted over 30 recommendation letters for two students based on our joint work.</li> <li>Both interns and visitors can work remotely, and time zone differences are not an issue for me, as I’m accustomed to it. We can discuss the specifics and come to an agreement; these roles are more flexible compared to those of PhD students.</li> <li>I strongly encourage active discussion and collaboration within the group, and I hope all students will participate actively in our meetings and share their research findings.</li> </ul> <h3 id="some-key-points">Some Key Points</h3> <ul> <li>I hope that the research interests of the applicants align well with mine, as I want to provide hands-on guidance to each student in their research, including brainstorming paper ideas, designing experiments, writing and submitting papers, and handling rebuttals. While modifying code may be more challenging, I am willing to assist with that as well.</li> <li>I do not place much emphasis on the educational background of applicants; instead, I value their attitudes toward learning and work, as well as their ability to handle pressure. In my view, most research on LLMs is not rocket science; it often requires a rigorous mindset and perseverance. When I refer to the ability to handle pressure, I don’t mean that I will impose stress on students—rather, you may need to be self-motivated. The current AI research community is vast, and the review process can be uncertain. Sometimes, our submissions may not receive recognition from reviewers, and publishing papers is crucial for job searches after earning a PhD. Even if our prior submission fails, I hope we can work together to ultimately publish quality work.</li> <li>I strongly encourage collaboration with researchers in academia and industry worldwide. This includes exchange programs during the PhD with universities in North America, Europe, and Singapore, as well as internships at companies. Having benefited from global collaborations myself, I have established connections that I can leverage to help you networking.</li> <li>Regarding my mentoring style, I hold at least one one-on-one discussion each week. If you need to discuss something, feel free to reach out or leave a message, and I will arrange a short meeting as soon as possible. Additionally, I organize weekly group meetings to help students understand each other’s research directions, and I regularly invite researchers from around the world to give talks during paper-sharing sessions.</li> <li>As HKUST (GZ) is a new university, if you are highly concerned about the institution’s reputation and ranking, it may not be the right fit for you.</li> </ul> <h3 id="application-process">Application Process</h3> <p>Please send your email to cartusguo@gmail.com. To enhance efficiency, kindly include the following key points in your message:</p> <ul> <li>Research Direction: Share your research area and any publication records. If you don’t have publications, feel free to outline your research interests instead.</li> <li>Interest in My Work: Specify which of my research directions or papers interest you, and what particular area you wish to pursue if you join my team.</li> <li>Additional Information: Attach any relevant documents, such as your resume or transcripts. Please format the attachments as “Year-Position-Your Name-Affiliation” (e.g., “25Fall-PhD-Wukong-SYSU”).</li> </ul> <p>I typically respond to most emails quickly, whether to schedule an interview or to indicate that we may not be a good fit. If you don’t hear back from me for a while, it means I’m still considering your application and may need additional time. Thank you for your understanding!</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Zhijiang Guo.
